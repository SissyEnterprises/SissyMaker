# SissyMaker
A fun project for turning people into sissies ðŸ’˜
</div>

## Disclaimer
This project is only intended for people who are aged **18+**
This project is intended for people who **WILLINGLY** become sissified. We do however employ various various techniques that when employed could lead to undesired sissification for otherwise normal people. Much like hacking this project is in no way illegal just based on the techniques used, what would make it illegal is if they were used in an illegal way, which they are not,  all participants are exploicitly warned about the potential effects of this system.

## Plans
There are a lot of ideas and a lot of potential for this project. Here's some of them!
  1. Games
  2. Videos
  3. Images
  4. Hypnosis

## Financing
The project currently has no planned budget. We would love to set up a Patreon, maybe a Kickstarter, and a PayPal account for accepting donations and sponsorship, but for now there is no money in the project.

Here are some things I would love to afford for the project:
  - A server to host an API
